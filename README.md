CS 3113 Final Project 

This game was created by Mithila Das and Andrew Lucero

We worked with boilerplate code that was provided by Professor Ivan Safrin, during the Spring 2019 semester of CS-3113 Intro to Game Programming. 

At the moment, the controls are as follows: 
Left Arrow Key - move left 
Right Arrow Key - move right 
Space - jump
W - create barrier above player
S - create barrier below player
A - propels player upwards, away from wall (can only be used if player's left side collides with specific block)
D - propels player upwards, away from wall (can only be used if player's right side collides with specific block)



The point of the game is to reach the goal at the end of the level as fast as possible.
If a player collides with spikes, they will die. If instead, the player has a barrier below them that collides with the spikes, they will be propelled upwards. 
In order to keep the player moving, there are spikes pretty much everywhere, except the starting platform.
