CS 3113 Final Project 

Since my partner and I have different OSs, this repo will be used to hold onto our main file, and other useful files, like the assets we are going to use, and a text document for what needs to be implemented. 


Controls: 
Left + Right - Move
Space - Jump 
A + D - wall jump left and right 
W + S - spawn hitboxes to prevent yourself from hitting the dangerous tile or kill a bomb
