Physics of our game
	- There should be four types of enitities minimum	
		- player
		- tile
		- dangerous tile 
		- annoying 
	- Collision 
		- player + solid tile
			- nothing. This is just like being on the floor 

		- player + dangerous tile/annoying
			- if direct contact, player dies. 
			- if player hits, player is propelled in a direction based on where they were in relation. 
				- if annoying is hit, it will disappear
				- Currently, the plan to handle hitting, is to create an entity directly connected to the player that will collide instead of the player. With this logic:
					- hitbox is on the left/right: player is propelled in opposite direction, diagonally
					- hitbox is above/below: player is propelled in opposite direction

		- annoying + dangerous tile/tile
			- disappears
